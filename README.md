# Scientific Computing with Python ‚Äì freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my completed projects for the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification offered by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). As part of the certification, I was tasked with completing five hands-on challenges that demonstrate my understanding of Python fundamentals, data manipulation, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic problem solving.

Each project focuses on a core Python programming concept and was built from scratch using **pure Python** and standard libraries like `math`, `datetime`, and `random`, while following clean, readable, and modular coding practices.
