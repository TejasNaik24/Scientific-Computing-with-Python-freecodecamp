# 🧮 Scientific Computing with Python – freeCodeCamp Certification Projects

This repository contains my completed projects for the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification offered by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python).  
As part of this certification, I built **five hands-on Python projects** that demonstrate algorithmic thinking, clean code practices, and computational problem solving using Python’s standard libraries.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### ➕ Arithmetic Formatter
Formats and aligns arithmetic problems vertically, displaying the answers if requested.  
**Concepts used:** string manipulation, loops, and conditionals.

### ⏰ Time Calculator
Adds a time duration to a start time and returns the new time and day.  
**Concepts used:** time arithmetic, modular math, and string parsing.

### 💰 Budget App
A budgeting class that tracks deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, and generates a text-based spend chart.  
**Concepts used:** OOP, data visualization (text), and modular design.

### 📐 Polygon Area Calculator
Calculates the area and perimeter of geometric shapes (like rectangles and squares) and allows dynamic shape manipulation.  
**Concepts used:** classes, inheritance, and geometry formulas.

### 🎲 Probability Calculator (Hat Simulation)
Simulates random draws from a hat filled with colored balls to estimate probabilities through experiments.  
**Concepts used:** randomness, probability, and simulation.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through these projects, I strengthened my understanding of:

- **Python fundamentals** (loops, conditionals, and data structures)  
- **Object-oriented programming** and class design  
- **Simulation and probability modeling**  
- **Algorithmic problem solving** and debugging  
- **Modular, readable code structure**
